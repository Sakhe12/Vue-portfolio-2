                    <p class="lead">I was born in the township of Gugulethu at the beginning of the new century. I started and completed my High School education at Goodwood College, matriculating with a bachelor's pass in 2017.

                        <br>
                        I then enrolled at UWC in the year 2018 studying BA majoring in Politics and History since I love History. I however dropped out in 2021 as I fell out of love with politics and then joined the workforce for a couple of years as I was searching for my true passion. There was always something about programming and software development that intrigued me. The problem solving, the software creation, the web-development. I just knew that I was somehow made for this. I was then fortunate enough to get accepted to study Web development at Life Choices Academy, an opportunity I have grabbed with both hands and I must say I love it with all it's glory and challenges.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
I consider myself an intelligent, responsible and dedicated person. I am eager to learn improve and explore all the possibilities that the world of programming and designing offers.</p>
